Cristobal did this animation with her girl, who is an amazing graphic designer. It is of her baby girl Taika traveling through La Gran Sabana, a paradise in Venezuela.

The formations in the back are called tepuis and are the result of at least 2000 million years of erosion that have cut through the rock. The tepuis were formed before the dinosaurs, before the continents divided, before the Atlantic ocean was formed, before the first form of life came out of the sea. There are 115 tepuis in La Gran Sabana and all of them have different ecosystems and endemic species that are only found in that particular tepui. Some have a surface that spans for hundreds of kms and can be as tall at 1200 mts. This animation depicts tepuis Wadaka Piapo, Yuruani, Kukenan and Roraima.

Her hope is that one day the world can get to know this amazing place as we know it.
